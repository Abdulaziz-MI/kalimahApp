 Kalimah App - JS
 
The Quran-based web app intended to strengthen your companionship with the Quran

After starting the challenge, a verse and it's transaltion will be presented from the Quran. One word will be missing form the traslation.

This challenge requires you to read the verse and figure out the missing word from the translation.

This is intended to strengthen the understanding of the Quran for students of the arabic language in a beneficial way.

There is a textbox to input the answer, a submit button, and a reveal button wherein the missing word will be revealed alongside the Arabic tafsir (explanation) of the verse from the famous Tafseer al-Muyassar.

After submitting the correct answer, the word will appear alongside the tafsir.

Translations often don't give the full meaning especially since Arabic is a richer language than English, so if you recall the correct meaning and understanding of the word then you are successfull, regardless whether you figured the specific word or not. It is about understanding.

This is only the begining stage of the challenge, I aim to make major improvements as I develop my skills and recieve feedback.
