## The Challenge

 <img width="1439" alt="Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 15 31 22" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107209170/218256635-2d225088-90a1-4bff-9c0c-e6a7ce0bd230.png">

A random verse and it's transaltion will be presented from the Quran. One word will be missing from the traslation.

This challenge requires you to read the verse and figure out the missing word from the translation.

The user is expected to read the arabic verse and figure out the missing word from the translation. using the text input, After submitting the correct answer, a scholarly ecplanation of the verse will be displayed with a success message. There is also a reveal button in case the user struggles.


Translations often don't give the full meaning especially since Arabic is a rich language, so if you recall the correct meaning and understanding of the word then you are successfull, It is about understanding.

This is only the begining stage of the app, I aim to make major improvements.
